            <i> Hands-on cryptanalysis - The DojoCrypt platform and an introduction to CLAASP </i>i>
            <details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    In this tutorial, we introduce DojoCrypt, an experimental cloud-based platform designed to streamline cryptography and cryptanalysis research and development. Offering a pre-configured environment with powerful tools—including cryptanalysis frameworks (e.g. CLAASP, TAGADA, CASCADA, CryptoSMT), hacking utilities (e.g. John-the-Reaper, Hashcat), mathematical libraries (e.g. SageMath), and AI-powered solutions—DojoCrypt eliminates the complexity of software setup and resource management. 
To showcase DojoCrypt’s capabilities for both teaching and research, we demonstrate its integration with the CLAASP library—a SageMath-based suite designed to simplify the analysis of symmetric primitives. After a brief overview of CLAASP, we implement a basic toy cipher and execute various cryptanalysis routines, such as statistical testing, linear/differential trail searches, algebraic modeling, and result visualization, all achieved in a few lines of code.

            <i> CLAASP 3.0: automated search of impossible differential, differential-linear and algebraic distinguishers </i>i>
            <details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    The search for algebraic, impossible differential, and differential-linear distinguishers is a key topic in symmetric cryptanalysis. Existing automated tools are often highly specialized or lack support for one of these types of distinguishers. In this talk, we will demonstrate through practical examples how the latest version of CLAASP can automatically search for impossible differential and differential-linear distinguishers using state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we will showcase methods that use truncated deterministic differentials to find these kind of distinguishers. Additionally, we will show how CLAASP can automatically search for algebraic distinguishers through the use of techniques based on the three-subset division property.

            <i> Automating Neural Cryptanalysis  </i>i> 
            <details>
    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    At CRYPTO 2019, Aron Gohr proposed neural networks as a tool for the cryptanalysis of block ciphers. His neural distinguishers are trained to learn to recognize the distribution induced by the encryption of plaintext pairs with a given XOR difference from that of random pairs. In his seminal work, these distinguishers were used to build state-of-the-art, practical key recoveries on round-reduced SPECK32.
At FSE 2023, we presented the AutoND framework, which aims at automating the process of neural cryptanalysis, by eliminating the tedious process of hyperparameters tuning and other cipher-specific optimizations. In this talk, we present the tool, how to unleash its full potential through CLAASP, and how to integrate it with other similar libraries.
