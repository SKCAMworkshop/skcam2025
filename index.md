Welcome to the home page of the **1st Workshop on Symmetric-key Cryptanalysis Automation and Modelling**. This workshop will be held on one day at **Universit√† degli Studi Roma Tre, Rome, Italy**, the **15th of March 2025**. The workshop will be held just before [FSE 2025](https://fse.iacr.org/2025/).

SKCAM is held to promote research on all domains related to the automation and modelling of cryptanalysis on symmetric-key primitives. Broadly, the scope of the workshop includes, but is not limited to:
* Implementation and general development of automated tools for cryptanalysis
* New or improved cryptanalysis modelling techniques 
* Algorithmic considerations of automated cryptanalysis

The program contains invited talks and discussion sessions. Any researcher is welcome to contact us to participate.
